# Code of Conduct 
Our interest is to foster an open and welcoming environment.
We want all kinds of people to feel safe and comfortable participating as ambassadors for Chimoney. 
All ambassadors pledge to make participation in Chimoney and the Chimoney community a harassment-free experience for everyone. 
Be respectful. Chimoney stands for inclusivity. 
We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment. 
Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. 
If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at the Chimoney Community or Event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a Chimoney representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document. 
Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, and veteran status. 
Additional cases of harassment include but are not limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. 
If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. 
Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, Chimoney staff, and anyone else participating in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment. 
Consequences
If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the Chimoney team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Chimoney may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type. 
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Chimoney using the reporting procedures defined below.
Chimoney representatives can help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance. 
We expect participants to follow these rules at all Chimoney groups, gatherings, online interactions in relation to the event, Chimoney-related social events, and on supplied transportation.
